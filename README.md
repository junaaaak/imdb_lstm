# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews using LSTM

This project performs **sentiment classification** on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using deep learning.  
It builds and compares two LSTM-based neural network models:  
- **Model 1:** A simple LSTM network  
- **Model 2:** A Bidirectional LSTM with Dropout and Dense layers

The workflow covers:
- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Text tokenization and padding  
- Model training and validation  
- Evaluation using confusion matrices and classification reports  
- Performance visualization with accuracy plots  
- Model saving for future use

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Total samples:** 22,150 reviews  
- **Sentiment distribution:** ~50% Positive / ~50% Negative  
- **Average review length:** ~231 words

## ðŸ§  Model Details

| Model | Architecture | Test Accuracy |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Model 1** | Simple LSTM (64 units) | **84.4%** |
| **Model 2** | Bidirectional LSTM (64 units) + Dropout | 81.8% |

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Insights

- **Model 1 (Simple LSTM)** achieved slightly better generalization with **higher accuracy (84%)** and balanced precision/recall.  
- **Model 2 (BiLSTM + Dropout)** performed well but slightly underfit compared to Model 1 in this experiment, achieving ~82% accuracy.  
- Training curves show that **Model 1 converged faster and more stably**, whereas Model 2â€™s validation accuracy plateaued and fluctuated in later epochs.
